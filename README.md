<h1>Minesweeper</h1>
<p>Minesweeper is a popular single-player computer game. Created by Robert Donner in 1989, the objective is to uncover a minefield without any of the mines being detonated.</p>
<h2>Game rules</h2>
<p>The playing area consists of a rectangular field of squares. Each square can be revealed by clicking on it, and if the clicked square contains a mine, then the game is over. If, on the other hand, the square does not contain a mine, one of two things can happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A number is revealed. Indicate the number of adjacent squares that contain mines;</li>
  <li>no numbers are revealed. In this case, the game automatically reveals the adjacent squares around the empty square, as they cannot contain mines;</li>
</ul>
<p>The game ends when all squares that do not contain mines are revealed.</p>
